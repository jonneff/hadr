Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief

There is a misconception that neural networks require enormous amounts of data, specialized expertise and a lot of time to develop.  The purpose of this study is to dispel these misconceptions and demonstrate that excellent results can be obtained quickly for image and text classification problems given a suitable labeled data set.  

The application chosen for this study is humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, one of the high priority national mission initiatives of the recently established Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.  Satellite and airborne imagery are important data sources for situational awareness after disasters.  Several studies have shown that social media such as Twitter and Facebook can also be important sources of information during humanitarian assistance operations.  

In this study, I use AI to automatically classify satellite imagery and social media data to provide situational awareness during disaster relief operations.  Data sets included satellite imagery from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Twitter text data from the 2014 California earthquake, and images posted on social media from the Nepal earthquake in 2015.  

This study shows that state of the art results can be obtained using off the shelf technologies with little effort in a very short time.
